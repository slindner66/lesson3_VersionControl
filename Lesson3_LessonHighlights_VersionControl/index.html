            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning control systems are used by a group of members to work on project files.  It creates a work environment that includes one main repository for all of the project files.  These files can be checked out by members of the team, changes can then be made, and then the files are committed or checked back in.  VCS's will make note of who altered the files and what is different, show when the files were changed, and can then merge changes that were made to the same file.  This can be very useful when collaborating on a project with a team or even when it is just one individual.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems are composed of two different kinds of repositorys.  They are known as remote repositorys and local repositorys.  A remote repository is shared with multiple people working on the same project.  It is a repository that resides on a remote server.  Then there is the local repository.  This repository resides with an individual user on their local machine.  There are two methods to create a local repository.  You can either create a copy or clone of an existing remote repository to the local machine, or just simply create a brand new repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is known as a distributed version control system.  There are many advantages to using a distributed version control system.  Some of these advantages are listed below.  A copy of the repository data is stored on each users local machine.  This allows for the users to work offline and makes it so there is no single point of failure. Distributed version control systems also run extreamly fast and it also prevents an accidental overwrite of a file that is shared by users on the shared repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT commands include your basic commands as well as your remote commands.  A GIT command always starts with "git" and then is followed by the command.  Some basic GIT commands include:  init, status, add --all, log, and commit.  Some of the remote commands include:  remote, pull, and push.  There are three basic steps to the GIT commands.  Step 1:  Add, Step 2: Commit, and Step 3:  Push.  First using the working copy you add to the staging area.  From here you "commit" to the local repository.  Then you "push" to the remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why Version Control Systems Are So Useful.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system like GIT has many advantages.  It eliminates the need to save multiple files all with different names and dates.  This can get very confusing and difficult to manage.  GIT also makes it possible for multiple users that are collaborating on the same project to do so without conflicts that can't easily be resolved.  This not only makes a project collaboration more organized, but also allows for increased productivty by the collaborating group.</p>
